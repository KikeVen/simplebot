To grow this script into a more capable chatbot there are number modifications needed.

* Future enhancement: SimpleBot would benefit greatly from being integrated with user sessions, allowing for multiple and more complex conversations between users and the bot.
* Try to expand and improve the conversation.
* Refine the classifier.
* Expand the level of granularity in the train corpus with more detailed answers without generating false positives.
